## topics:
  - Generation of LFR benchmark networks (Python + networkX library). Parameters and their effect on network structure
  - Community detection on LFR: performance (measured by NMI, number of communities, community size distribution)
  - Effect of ranodm seed on results. When and how to improve robustness of results using "consensus community detection"
  - R code for effective visualization (R + ighraph + tidyverse)
  - R code for custom layouts (R + ighraph + tidyverse)
 

## pre-requisites: 
installation of R and R Studio + basic knowledge of their use.
optional: Python interpreter installed
